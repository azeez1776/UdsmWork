        <h3>education background</h3>
        <p>I begun my primary education in the year 2007 at ST.MARY'S INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS and sat for my standard seven examination
            in 2011 at MWALIMU JK. NYERERE SCHOOLS.
            then I finished my ordinary level studies at ST.JOSEPH USAMBARA GIRLS SECONDARY SCHOOL
            in the year 2017 and later joined ST. MARY'S MAZINDE JUU for my
            advanced level studies and graduated at 2020.</p>
        <h3>university course</h3>
        <p> I am currently enrolled at the university of Dar-es-salaam as a computer science first year student
            I enrolled this course because apart from loving programming
            it is a three year program. My favourite courses are programming in c and web programmming and that is because
            I enjoy designing and making things look beautiful,all thanks to CSS.if web programming had no css
            then maybe it wouldn't have been my favourite.</p>
